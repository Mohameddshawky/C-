📘 Learning C# – A Beginner to Intermediate Journey

This repository contains my personal learning journey in C#, covering key programming concepts, language features, and practical exercises. It includes:

✅ Basics of C# syntax and data types

🔁 Control flow: conditionals and loops

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)

📂 File handling and exception management

🧪 Practice problems and mini-projects

🛠️ Working with Visual Studio and .NET CLI

The goal of this repo is to document my progress, solidify my understanding, and serve as a helpful resource for others beginning their C# journey.
